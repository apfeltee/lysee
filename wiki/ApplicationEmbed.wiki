= Embed Lysee Step By Step =

This page will lead you create a expression evaluating application called _*calc.lpi*_, show you how to embed lysee into this program to expand its capabilities.

*1. Create Project*

  # Open lazarus and create a _*Application*_ project.
  # Save this project as _*calc.lpi*_.
  # Same Unit1 as frmcalc.pas.
  # Place a label editor to main form and rename it as 'eExpr'.
  # Place a label editor to main form and rename is as 'eResult'.
  # Place a button to main form and rename it as 'bCalc'.
  
*1. Add Lysee Kernel File To Project*

  * Copy _*lseu.pas*_ and _*lse_kernel.pas*_ to your project directory.
  * Add them to your project.
  * Add them to *uses* clause.

It looks like this:
{{{
uses
  lseu, lse_kernel;
}}}

*2. Setup Framework*

  * Call _*lse_startup*_ firstly to initialize lysee kernel.
  * Call _*lse_cleanup*_ finally to release lysee kernel.

{{{
begin
  lse_startup;
  try
    // Put using-lysee codes here
  finally
    lse_cleanup;
  end;
end
}}}
