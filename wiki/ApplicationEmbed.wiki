Lysee kernel has only two files: lseu.pas, lse_kernel.pas. The next is steps of how to embed lysee kernel into your application and works find.

*1. Add lysee kernel to your project*

  * Copy lseu.pas and lse_kernel.pas to your project directory.
  * Add them to your project.
  * Add them to *uses* clause.

It looks like this:
{{{
uses
  lseu, lse_kernel;
}}}

*2. Setup Framework*

  * Call _*lse_startup*_ to initialize lysee kernel.
  * Call _*lse_cleanup*_ to release lysee kernel.

{{{
begin
  lse_startup;
  try
    // Put using-lysee codes here
  finally
    lse_cleanup;
  end;
end
}}}
